introduction: In this module, the self-study material focuses on sensors and the data they generate in the form of time-series. We will explore the most common sensors with their challenges and opportunities. We will introduce the concept of events as data point inputs are ingested by the system and trigger actions. Finally, we will distinguish between different options of data processing.

## Code Management

Managing code refers to its organisation from inside a single file to handling many files and folders over time. This organisation is vital for any project as tits code grows organically.

Inside a file, we structure code in `functions`, which typically group a set of `statements` together to perform an action. 

Zooming out, each file of your project contains a set of functions. 
Module => a python file
Package => a directory with Python module
