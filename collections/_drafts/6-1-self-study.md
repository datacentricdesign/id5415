introduction: In this module, the self-study material focus on product analytics. Zooming out from one prototype to a fleet of products, we will explore what makes a 'data product' and how data can be used in different ways depending on the lens and scale. In this context, we will touch on designers' responsibilities regarding privacy.

Data provides designers with a unique opportunity to take responsibility over the impact of their solutions.

# Data products

<span class="mdi mdi-text-box-outline"></span> Reading (30 minutes)

There are many different definitions of what a data product is. So we will start by setting a definition for this course. `Data products` are products that would not be possible without the use of data in their creation, in the process of building them.

This data requirement can come from three angles.

* **A functionality of the product relies on a data-driven algorithm.** For example, the [Nest thermostat](https://nest.com/) is capturing contextual data as well as user interaction. All the data feed a machine learning algorithm that drives the main functionality of the product.
* **A business model relying on the data.** The '[you're Not the Customer; You're the Product](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/)' from the 1970s was referring to the television advertisements being the core business proposition, sold to companies to target their audience. [Google](https://ads.google.com/home/) brought this to a new level, using data to disseminate personalised advertisement to each individual. A product such as [Mobike](https://mobike.com/global/) tracking location or the [June Oven](https://juneoven.com/) taking pictures of every meal cooked in the oven illustrate the next step of this process in the physical world.
* **A decision process supported or automated by data.** Here the data serve the continuous and iterative design process. Navin Iyengar illustrates this approach as a Product Designer at Netflix in his talk [Design Like a Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRd6Ddn4ZSY).

## Data and connected products

As mentioned in the introduction of the course, the Internet of Things enabling the connected products is all about data, driving the

difference between building a software 'agile design process' and a data product, with an 'experimental design process'

that's where it starts connecting with prototyping

user experience in the context of data products, non-deterministic but probabilistic

When you design, you do not know how the data is going to look like

## Story telling

As a designer

Dashboard: make sure you communicate clearly to the rest of your team, which insights you are counting on top learn from the current version of the product/prototype for the next iteration.

# IoT Manifesto

Throughout the course, we highlighted the power of designers with connected product and data. In this final section, we walk through [The IoT Design Manifesto](https://www.iotmanifesto.com/)to unpack its guidelines for responsible design in a connected world.
