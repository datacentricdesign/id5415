# Step 3 - Pre-Analysis
Given our work and experience with the prototype so far, and this list of possible information we could extract, go over each of the examples
(and your own), and briefly explain, before looking at the data, what you might predict is the answer to these questions, and how feasible
you estimate geting an answer to these questions with your current data is. 


# Step 4 - Relating possible trends and insights with prototype
At this point we have some enquiry points (step 2), some preliminary analysis of these, with perceived weaknesses, and the current status of the prototype given the initial vision concept. Before we try to answer these questions, we must first relate to their **relevancy** towards the development or analysis of this product. Going back to the initial concept of the course (in introduction) and its goals,  for each of these questions, relate them to this and the relevant components of the system. 
Example: 
A key point of the good night lamp is subtle non direct interaction between houses. knowing the peaks of activity between prototypes and how they relate to eachtother allows us to know if these products are in sync ( are we interacting mostly at the same time, or are most events missed by the other party?)  when several devices are active at the same time,  can we devise new interactions? 
On the other side, is the product working properly? Is the rate/distribution of events reasonable?
