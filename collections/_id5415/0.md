  Welcome to Prototyping Connected Products!

  In this course you will experience prototyping of a connected lighting system. In groups, you will go through three prototyping iterations with a strong focus on the technology and the functional implementation. You will rely on a Raspberry Pi -- small computer -- to sense contextual changes and control connected light bulbs via Python code. Your prototype will help you gain an understanding of the technologies through tests and data exploration.
explain: Explain the technology stack of Internet of Things and the role of prototyping in this context;
specify: Express design considerations using appropriate literacy for effective discussions with ICT engineers.
make: Develop a prototype of connected product by adapting and integrating pieces of code using Python;
collaborate: Document your prototyping process and collaborate with peers, using Git and GitHub;
analyse: Conduct and report a data collection campaign to generate sensor insights from sensor data;
evaluate: Motivate the selection of technological components;

## Activities

The course follows the blended learning approach. It is an 8-week course including 6 modules of one week, followed by a week of revision and an exam in the 10th week.

Each module involves:
- the introduction of theoretical concepts (2hrs) through self-study video and reading materials, followed by a formative quiz;
- a live demo (2hrs) with a lecturer walking through some of the concepts in practice, and offering students a key moment for questions;
- a programming assignment (4-8hrs) to develop in group the prototype of a home lighting system, with gradual complexity
- a lab experiment (4-8hrs) to test in group, making use of the prototype developed so far.

# Project

During this course you will prototype a connected lighting system in groups of three. 

You will choose the context of this system, whether it focus on comfort, energy, remote communication, room atmosphere, fitting activities, etc.


# Assessment

In this course you will be assessed with:

* **a documentation of your prototyping process (group, 40%)**
* **a live demonstration of your prototype with Q&A (group, 10%)**
* **an open book exam (individual, 50%)**
