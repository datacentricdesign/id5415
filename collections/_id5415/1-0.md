introduction: In this first module, you will learn to set up the prototype of a lighting system with a connected light bulb and a Raspberry Pi. By building and navigating a working system, you will familiarise yourself with the so-called technology stack through reverse engineering.
explain: Explain the purpose of a functional prototype, feasibility testing and the concept of the Internet of Things
make: Setup a Raspberry Pi as a home gateway for connected lighting
analyse: Reverse engineer (disassemble) the software components of a connected lighting system with the IoT Technology Stack
evaluate: 
specify: 
collaborate: 
live: In this first session, we will demonstrate make a quick tour of Visual Studio code, the development environment for this course. Then, we will delve into the basics of the command line (CLI) to control the connected light bulb. We will keep a lot of room for your questions regarding the course, the self-study material and the demonstration itself.
coach: In this first coaching session we will form teams of three for the project. It will take place both on-campus and online. You can find instructions for this session [here](/module1/coaching-session)
