introduction: In this module, the self-study material focus on Prototyping and the Internet of Things' technology stack. We explore the purpose of a functional prototype, in close connection to feasibility testing. Then, we look at connected products, there main characteristics and why they often require a (partially) functional prototype. Finally, we introduce the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), the technology backbone of connected products.

# Documentating


# Sandpit

In this sand pit, we will demonstrate the basic functionality of the kit that you will use throughout the course. We will discuss functional prototyping, connected product and the IoT's Technology stack in this context.

# Coaching Session

The first coaching session will be a matchmaking event. It will take place both on-campus and online
