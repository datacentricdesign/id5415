introduction: In this module, the self-study material focus on Prototyping and the Internet of Things' technology stack. We explore the purpose of a functional prototype, in close connection to feasibility testing. Then, we look at connected products, their main characteristics and why they often require a (partially) functional prototype. Finally, we introduce the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), the technology backbone of connected products.

# Connected Products

In this course, we refer to connected products as any physical entities with the ability to send or receive information through the Internet, in a direct way. It is a touchpoint between the physical and the digital world.

The term 'Thing' is commonly used to encapsulate the technologies  

Clair Rowland distinguishes 4 type of them[^1]:

Multipurpose computer => examples...
Specialised embedded devices => examples...
Connected sensors => examples...
Passively trackable object => examples...


Network, the connectivity part



Opportunities
interactions
data
intelligence


Challenges
complexity
dynamic
inter-dependence

# Prototyping

What is different about prototypes of connected products?

* hardware / software mix
* relying on digital technologies
* distributed, code running in many places
* network
* the senses and 


* Feasibility prototypes
* User Prototypes
* Live-Data Prototypes
* Hybrid Prototypes

* Testing techniques

* What do we mean by prototype
* What for?


# Internet of Things' Technology Stack

<span class="mdi mdi-pencil-ruler"></span> Video series (30 minutes)

We unpacked the particular prototyping needs for the design and development of connected products. These needs come from the Internet of Things, or the IoT, which is the technology behind product-service systems. Like an iceberg, the physical ‘Things’ are the tip, visible above water while most of the technology and complexity is hidden, immersed underwater.

In the following series of seven small videos, we shed light on this digital technology, mapping its literacy through a layered framework so-called ‘stack’. We explore what is the Internet of Things, extracting the key roles of designers in the development of product-service systems.
