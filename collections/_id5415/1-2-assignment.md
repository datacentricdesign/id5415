# Step 1: Light Bulb

In this step you will start interacting with a connected light bulb from TP-Link and explore its functionalities.

* Kasa app
* Control of the light
* Alternative architectures (direct/hub/cloud)

# Step 2: Home Hub

In this step you will use a Raspberry Pi to setup a home hub. This hub will run a program to control the connected light bulb.

## Task 2.1: Setting up

* Connect to Bucket and create a Raspberry Pi Thing, it triggers the generation of a custom image
* Run the Raspberry Pi
* Explore the Raspberry Pi, UNIX environment

## Task 2.2: Controlling the Light Bulb

* Connected-Home Web server running on the Pi 
* Add light bulb and control it from the hub
