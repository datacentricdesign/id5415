# Step 1: Identifying the IoT Stack

# Step 2: A Glimpse at Data

In this step you will start exploring two types of data: the logs generated by the hub to understand what is happening and the sensor data generated by the connected devices.

## Task 2.1: Logs

It is common for software to generate logs, so that maintainers can monitor it and look for information when things go wrong.

* Explore JSON logs from connected-home: format, information, role

## Task 2.2: Cloud/Grafana

By default, Connected-Home send all data to your data bucket in the cloud.

* Connect to Grafana, a timeseries visualisation tool
* Explore the data generated by the hub and the light bulb


# Step 3: Command-line

The Raspberry Pi is the core of our connected lighting system: a home 'hub'.

Let's access this small computer via the command line.
