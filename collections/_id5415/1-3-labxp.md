introduction: Lab experiment is the term we use in this course for making using of the prototype through test and analysis. In this Lab Experiment, we will explore the  data that is automatically generated from your Raspberry Pi. We will have a first taste of data exploration and use these insights to infer how the system works.
technique: Data Exploration, Reverse Engineering
metrics:
report: System Architecture, System Data Visualisation

# Step 1: Team work

From the matchmaking event of the first coaching session, you should now be part of a team. Throughout the course you will use GitHub as a platform to share your assignment code with the team and report on lab experiments.

**Note:** Keep in mind that during the coaching sessions you will receive feedback only based on what you share on this repository.


## Task 1: GitHub invitation

Use the GitHub invitation link shared by the course coordinator to create your repository. You will be prompt for the name of your team. Make sure you enter the same name as your teammates.

* src folder
* ChangeLog file

## Task 2: Markdown

Markdown is a markup language to quickly format text. This is the language used throughout the developer community to format code documentation. In this course you will use Markdown to report on assignments and lab experiments. Let's walk through the basics.

On GitHub, edit the README.md (.md for MarkDown).

TODO screenshot

The README.md file is the first document to show up when reaching your repository. Let's give it a personalised touch. Hash # signs are used for title. Create a contributors' section and list the name and 1-sentence bio of your team members.

```markdown
# Contributors

* John, ...
* Yu, ...
* Els, ...
```

You can preview your changes, then press the green button 'Commit changes' to save (more on this terminology in assignment 2).

You can add tables, images, links and so on with similar tags. We now set a introduction image. Click on the 'doc' folder then 'images'. Click on the drop down menu Add File > Upload files and drag and drop your image. Once again, press the green button 'Commit changes' to save (this can take a while).

Back to your README.md, type in the following at the top of the file (replace projectbanner.png by the name of your file):

```markdown
![Project Banner](doc/images/projectbanner.png)
```

A cheat sheet of Markdown can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

**What did we achieved?**

* we have a GitHub repository, ready to report a lab experiment
* we have some basics of formatting for reporting

# Step 1: Identifying the IoT's Technology Stack

In this step you will start exploring two types of data: the logs generated by the hub to understand what is happening and the sensor data generated by the connected devices.

In the self-study material we explored the IoT's technology stack. Let's identify the components of the 5 layers of this stack for our prototype.

* What are the device hardware components? 
* What are the device software components?
* What are the communication components?
* What are the cloud platform components?
* What are the cloud application components?

In this exercise, donot hesitate to distinguish:

* what you know and how?
* What you assume. In this case, what are the possibilities and why do you make this assumption?

**Report** On GitHub, in the doc folder, create a file architecture.md. Describe this IoT stack with text and diagrams.

There is no clear standard to represent an IoT Architecture. Your diagram should focus on what you think is important to highlight. However, keep in mind that your audience can be very divers from a Designer to a software or data engineering.

## Step 2: Logs

It is common for software to generate logs, so that the maintainers can monitor it and look for information when things go wrong.


TODO log exploration


**Report** On GitHub, in the doc folder, create a log.md file to explain the system currently log and what it tells you about how the system works.

### Task 2: Downloading Logs

It is often convenient to have the ability to explore log files on your laptop.

On your computer

```bash
scp
```

## Step 3: Cloud/Grafana

By default, Connected-Home send all data to your data bucket in the cloud.

* Connect to Grafana, a timeseries visualisation tool
* Explore the data generated by the hub and the light bulb

**Report** On GitHub, in the doc folder, create a file prototype_dashboard.md. Describe your prototype dashboard with text and screenshots. What can we see and what these metrics means?
