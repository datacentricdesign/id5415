# Step 1: Development Environment

Now that you have a working prototype of connected lighting system, let's see what's under the hood. In this last step you will setup your development environment to start modifying the behaviour of the lighting system.

## Task 1.1: Git and GitHub

* GitHub account and fork of Connected-Home

## Task 1.2: Visual Studio Code


* Retrieve code from the Git via VS Code
* Exploring the IDE UI
* Exploring the code structure, where/what are things

# Step 2: Python

## Task 2.1: Python

* Now diving more precisely into the code of a lighting service
* Main goal: getting familiar with Python

## Task 2.2: start coding

* Create a Git branch for a new feature
* Create a basic MyService that inherits from Service
* Define a behaviour, a specific reaction of the light bulb based on a trigger
* push changes

# Step 3: Collect Data
