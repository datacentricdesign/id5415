introduction: In the third module, you will further expand the complexity of your connected lighting system by adding sensing to the prototype, through light,  temperature, and humidity sensors. This will make its behaviour contextual!
explain: Explain the concepts of sensors, time series, events and data processing.
make: Collect data from sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi and trigger events.
analyse: Analyse time series data generated from sensors.
evaluate: Evaluate the quality of time series data and motivate alternative sensing options
specify:
collaborate: Collaborate with your team members around code development with Git and GitHub.
live: In this session, we will write some Python code to collect data from sensors. As usual, we will keep a significant room for your questions.
coach: This will be the second group session with your coach. You will receive feedback about what you reported on your GitHub repository.
