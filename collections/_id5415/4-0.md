introduction: In the fourth module, you will add networking capabilities to your system, which we will consider to be an additional sensory capability, further improving its contextual behaviour. For example, you will detect smartphones on the home network, providing an indication of inhabitants being at home or away from home.
explain: Explain the selection criteria that drive network choices that fit what you are designing.
make: Leverage the network infrastructure as a sensor.
analyse:
evaluate: Motivate the choice of network technology based on selection criteria
specify: Specify the network requirements of a connected product
collaborate: Collaborate with your team members around code development with Git and GitHub.
live: In this session, we finally establish the connection between several remote light bulbs. We also demonstrate how to use the local WiFi network as a sensor, to detect the presence of people in the house. As usual, we will keep a significant room for your questions.
coach: This will be the third group session with your coach. You will receive feedback about what you reported on your GitHub repository.
