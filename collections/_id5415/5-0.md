introduction: In the fifth module, you will teach the system to offer and access REST APIs. This will open the system for richer interaction and capability. For example, you will control your prototype from a smartphone and add the weather forecast to the context of your lighting system.
explain: Explain the concept of protocol, the network principles behind HTTP and MQTT and the fundamentals of web security.
make: Make calls to external web services and implement a REST API to open your connected product to external parties.
analyse:
evaluate: 
specify: Specify a REST API
collaborate: Collaborate with your team members around code development with Git and GitHub.
live: In this session, we will build a REST API and deploy it on the Raspberry Pi. We will also demonstrate how to use the  REST API of an existing web service. As usual, we will keep a significant room for your questions.
coach: This will be the fourth group session with your coach. You will receive feedback about what you reported on your GitHub repository.
