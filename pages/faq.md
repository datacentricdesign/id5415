# Question

## Python basics 
* **I cannot use my variable inside my function/my variable inside the function is "None" "NoneType"/how can I have save previous values between function calls**
  * > In python, when creating variables, global ones are available anywhere in the script, and local ones only inside the scope (for example function) . where they were created. the global keyword on line 32 is not creating the variable, just telling python that this name represents a global variable created somewhere else. you need this in case you want to change a global variable inside a function. You must create this variable somewhere else! [refer to this thread showing an example ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/423596)
